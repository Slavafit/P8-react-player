## Project Description 🚀

This project aimed to create a database and a REST API. Its goal is to develop a comprehensive management system that facilitates interaction between suppliers and users/customers. Suppliers will be able to query, add, modify, and delete product records in their catalog, as well as manage customer data to whom they provide services. Additionally, they can check product stock and filter products by brands. Brand management will also be available. On the other hand, customers will have the ability to place and view their orders through the Swagger interface. Suppliers, in turn, will be able to access placed orders and update their status to mark them as delivered and paid. The system will enable a smooth and efficient interaction between suppliers and customers, enhancing service quality and optimizing inventory and order management processes.

## Installation Process ⬆️

1. Clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguelcidoncha/APIWeb
2. Open the file using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
3. Open View/Server Explorer and add the connection to your computer using SQL Server.
4. In appsettings.json, add your SQL Server connection under "ServiceContext". Obtain information from properties.
5. Compile the code from Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
6. Once installed, in Swagger, to add content, you need to enter the Administrator 1 query: Username (Equipo 1) and password (BootCamp).
7. Create, modify, and delete content in Swagger.
8. View the stored data in the SQL Server tables.

## Next Steps 🔜
For the future, we would like to be able to add images to visually complement the products added. It would also be interesting to differentiate between types of customers/users, whether they are individuals or businesses/companies. Allowing users to create a profile to access various promotions or discounts would be beneficial as well. Similarly, we aim to configure the SQL Server to send purchase confirmations to users via email. Lastly, we plan to work on the front-end to create a web page that replaces the Swagger interface and link it with the database.
